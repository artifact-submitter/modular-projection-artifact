# Vaaler eq. (2.27): discharge of `VaalerJhatDerivCornerLimits` (the four removable corner limits)

This NEW leaf discharges the single named residual `VaalerJhatDerivCornerLimits` left open in
`VaalerJhatCorner`, namely the four removable corner limits of the explicit first/second
derivatives `jhatD1`, `jhatD2` of Vaaler's Fejér transform `Ĵ`.  Granting it, the committed
`vaalerJTwoIBPDecay_of_limits` / `jIntegrable_of_limits` close `VaalerJTwoIBPDecay` and
`JIntegrable`.

## The math (the smooth removed-cot factor `ψ`)

Write `ψ(τ) = cos(π τ)/sinc(π τ)`.  On a punctured nbhd of `0`,
`sinc(π τ) = sin(π τ)/(π τ)`, so

    ψ(τ) = cos(π τ)·(π τ)/sin(π τ) = π τ·cot(π τ),

and Vaaler's `Ĵ(τ) = π τ(1−τ)cot(π τ)+τ = (1−τ)·ψ(τ) + τ`.  Since `sinc` is real-analytic at
`0` (`Real.sinc = dslope Real.sin 0`, and the removable singularity of an analytic function is
analytic), `ψ` and hence the smooth completion `Jext τ := (1−τ)·ψ(τ) + τ` are `C^∞` near `0`.
Its derivatives at `0` are the genuine corner limits of `Ĵ'`, `Ĵ''`:

    Ĵ'(0) = 1 − ψ(0) + ψ'(0) = 0,        Ĵ''(0) = −2ψ'(0) + ψ''(0) = −2π²/3.

The corner `{1}` is handled by the exact reflection symmetry `jhatD1(1−u) = jhatD1(u)`,
`jhatD2(1−u) = −jhatD2(u)` (clean algebraic identities of the closed forms), reducing the corner
limits at `1` to those at `0`: `Ĵ'(1) = Ĵ'(0) = 0`, `Ĵ''(1) = −Ĵ''(0) = +2π²/3`.

The single genuinely-hard analytic input is the value `sinc''(0) = −1/3`, which Mathlib does not
carry.  We PROVE it from scratch via the identity `sin x = x·sinc x`: differentiating three times
and evaluating at `0` gives `−cos 0 = 3·sinc''(0)`, i.e. `sinc''(0) = −1/3`.  Everything else is
the product/chain rule on analytic functions.

## Hard constraints honoured

NEW leaf only; nothing existing/committed is edited.  No
`axiom`/`sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`False.elim`/`absurd`/`not_*_input`.
