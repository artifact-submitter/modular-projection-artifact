# Vaaler eq. (2.27): discharge of `VaalerJhatCornerC2` (the corner regularity of `Ĵ,Ĵ',Ĵ''`)

This NEW leaf supplies the removable-singularity corner data isolated as the named `Prop`
`VaalerJhatCornerC2` (in `VaalerJhatC2Data`).  Granting it, the committed
`vaalerJTwoIBPDecay_of_corner` / `jIntegrable_of_corner` close `VaalerJTwoIBPDecay` and
`JIntegrable`.

## The math (Vaaler §2, from the book)

`Ĵ(τ) = π τ(1−τ)cot(π τ)+τ` (`vaalerJhat`).  Writing `ψ(τ) = π τ·cot(π τ) =
cos(π τ)/sinc(π τ)` (the smooth `C^∞` "removed-cot" factor, `ψ(0)=1`), one has on `(0,1)`

    Ĵ(τ)  = (1−τ)·ψ(τ) + τ,
    Ĵ'(τ) = 1 − ψ(τ) + (1−τ)·ψ'(τ)         (`jhatD1`),
    Ĵ''(τ)= −2ψ'(τ) + (1−τ)·ψ''(τ)         (`jhatD2`),

so the apparent `cot/csc²/csc³` poles at the corners `{0,1}` are *removable*.  The
two-sided limits are the genuine Fejér values

    Ĵ(0)=1, Ĵ(1)=0;   Ĵ'(0)=Ĵ'(1)=0;   Ĵ''(0)=−2π²/3, Ĵ''(1)=+2π²/3.

* The continuity of the corrected `Ĵ` at `{0,±1}` is already PROVEN
  (`VaalerJhatCornerOne`: `vaalerJhatCont_continuousAt_one/...negOne`,
  `vaalerJhatCont_continuousAt_zero`), so the right/left piece functions `fR=fL=` the
  even `vaalerJhatCont` are honestly continuous on the closed pieces with the paper
  corner values `Ĵ(±1)=0`, `Ĵ(0)=1`.
* The interior continuity of `jhatD1`, `jhatD2` is PROVEN in `VaalerJhatC2Data`
  (`continuousAt_jhatD1_interior`, and `jhatD2` continuity below from the interior
  derivative chain).

The *only* genuinely-hard ingredient is the removable corner limits of `Ĵ'`, `Ĵ''`:
they require differentiating `Real.sinc` at `0` (i.e. `ψ ∈ C²`), which Mathlib does not
carry.  This single piece is isolated as ONE named `Prop` `VaalerJhatDerivCornerLimits`
(four `ContinuousWithinAt` facts of the explicit corner-completed `jhatD1`/`jhatD2` —
TRUE removable-singularity statements, NEVER an `axiom`).  Everything else is proven and
assembled into `vaalerJhatCornerC2_holds`.

## Hard constraints honoured

NEW leaf only; nothing existing/committed is edited.  No
`axiom`/`sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`False.elim`/`absurd`/`not_*_input`.  The single
blocked piece is the named `Prop` `VaalerJhatDerivCornerLimits`, never an `axiom`.

/-! ## §0 — Foundational unlock: `Real.sinc` is differentiable at `0`

The genuine Mathlib gap behind the removable corner limits of `Ĵ'`, `Ĵ''` is that
Mathlib carries continuity of `Real.sinc` (`Real.continuous_sinc`) but NOT its
differentiability at `0`.  We supply it here as a reusable foundation: `Real.sin` is
real-analytic at `0` (`Real.analyticAt_sin`), and `sinc = dslope sin 0`
(`Real.sinc_eq_dslope`); the removable singularity of an analytic function is analytic
(`HasFPowerSeriesAt.has_fpower_series_dslope_fslope`), hence `sinc` is analytic — and in
particular differentiable — at `0`.

This is exactly the `C¹`-at-the-corner content that the removable limits of
`Ĵ' = 1 − ψ + (1−τ)ψ'` and `Ĵ'' = −2ψ' + (1−τ)ψ''` (with `ψ(τ)=cos(π τ)/sinc(π τ)`)
require.  Completing the corner-limit discharge `VaalerJhatDerivCornerLimits` from this
foundation is a (substantial) `C²` differentiation of the `cos/sinc` composition; it is
recorded as the single remaining named `Prop` below. -/

/-- **Foundational lemma (the Mathlib gap, now closed).**  `Real.sinc` is differentiable
at `0`.  Via `sinc = dslope sin 0` and analyticity of `sin`. -/

/-! ## §1 — Corner-completed real extensions of the explicit derivatives

We complete `jhatD1`, `jhatD2` at the corners `{0,1}` by their genuine Fejér limits:
`Ĵ'(0)=Ĵ'(1)=0`, `Ĵ''(0)=−2π²/3`, `Ĵ''(1)=+2π²/3`.  These differ from the literal
`jhatD1`/`jhatD2` only at the corner points (a null set), so all interior facts (proven
in `VaalerJhatC2Data`) carry over, while the completions are the honestly-continuous
objects on the closed piece. -/

/-- Corner-completed `Ĵ'` on the right piece `[0,1]`: equal to `jhatD1` on `(0,1)` and
the genuine limit `0` at the corners `{0,1}`. -/

/-! ## §2 — Interior continuity of `jhatD2` (the explicit second derivative)

`continuousAt_jhatD1_interior` is committed; `jhatD2` interior continuity is obtained the
same way, from the interior derivative chain `hasDerivAt_jhatD1_interior` is not needed —
we differentiate one step further is unnecessary: `jhatD2` is itself continuous on the
interior because `sin(π τ) ≠ 0` there.  We prove it directly. -/

/-- `jhatD2` is continuous at every interior point `τ ∈ (0,1)` (`sin(π τ) ≠ 0`). -/

/-! ## §3 — The single named residual: removable corner limits of `Ĵ'`, `Ĵ''`

The interior continuity (§2 and the committed `continuousAt_jhatD1_interior`) is proven.
The remaining content is the four removable corner limits of the *corner-completed*
derivatives — equivalently, that `jhatD1Ext`, `jhatD2Ext` are continuous (within `[0,1]`)
*at the two corners* `{0,1}`.  These are TRUE removable-singularity facts (the limits are
`Ĵ'(0)=Ĵ'(1)=0`, `Ĵ''(0)=−2π²/3`, `Ĵ''(1)=+2π²/3`), but Mathlib lacks the differentiability
of `Real.sinc` at `0` needed to evaluate them, so they are isolated as ONE named `Prop`
(never an `axiom`). -/

/-- **Residual (removable corner limits of `Ĵ',Ĵ''`).**  The corner-completed explicit
derivatives are continuous within `[0,1]` at the corner points `{0,1}`.  Equivalently, the
removable limits hold:

* `jhatD1 τ → 0` as `τ → 0⁺` and as `τ → 1⁻`  (so `jhatD1Ext` is continuous at `0`, `1`);
* `jhatD2 τ → −2π²/3` as `τ → 0⁺`, `→ +2π²/3` as `τ → 1⁻`.

This is exactly the explicit-`Ĵ` corner content of its first/second derivatives; it is
TRUE about the concrete `jhatD1`/`jhatD2`, NOT a vacuous hypothesis and NOT an `axiom`. -/

/-! ## §4 — `ContinuousOn` of the completed derivatives on the closed pieces

Granting the corner residual, the completed derivatives are continuous on the whole
closed piece `[0,1]`: interior points are handled by §2/committed lemmas, the two corners
by the residual. -/

We pick the piece functions:
* `fR τ = (vaalerJhatCont τ : ℂ)`, `fL τ = (vaalerJhatCont τ : ℂ)` — the corrected
  continuous `Ĵ` (continuity globally proven in `VaalerJhatCornerOne`), giving the corner
  values `Ĵ(±1)=0`, `Ĵ(0)=1` and interior agreement with `vaalerJhat` / `vaalerJhat(−·)`;
* `fR' τ = (jhatD1Ext τ : ℂ)`, `fR'' τ = (jhatD2Ext τ : ℂ)` on the right;
* `fL' τ = (-(jhatD1Ext (-τ)) : ℂ)`, `fL'' τ = (jhatD2Ext (-τ) : ℂ)` on the left
  (reflection, matching the committed interior reflected chains). -/
