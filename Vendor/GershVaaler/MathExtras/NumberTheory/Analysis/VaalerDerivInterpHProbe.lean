# D-1 de-risk probe: term-by-term differentiation of the Beurling interpolant `interpH`

This NEW leaf is a **de-risk probe** for the single remaining D-1 wall

    deriv interpH = 2 · J      on (0,∞)  and (−∞,0)      (Vaaler eq (2.32), J = ½H′)

isolated by both Route A (`Real.fourier_deriv`) and Route B (improper IBP,
`VaalerCor7RouteB`).  The wall decomposes into two sub-facts:

* **(i)** `deriv interpH` exists with a closed form off ℤ, via term-by-term
  differentiation of the bracket tsum `interpBracket` (Mathlib
  `hasDerivAt_tsum_of_isPreconnected`).
* **(ii)** the resulting function's Fourier transform equals the closed form
  `Ĵ = vaalerJhatFT` (Vaaler Theorem 6, eqs (2.27)–(2.32)).

This file PROVES the genuinely cheap pieces of (i) — the per-term derivatives, the
local uniform `‖g′ n y‖ ≤ u n` bound that powers `hasDerivAt_tsum_of_isPreconnected`
on a real ball off ℤ, the summability of the derivative series, and the closed-form
`HasDerivAt` for ONE of the two bracket tsums — and records the precise feasibility
verdict for the full wall.

## What is PROVEN here (sorry/axiom-free, non-vacuous)

* `hasDerivAt_invSq_shift` — per term `d/dx (x − c)⁻² = −2 (x − c)⁻³` for `x ≠ c`.
* `tailDerivSummable_pos` — for `x > 0`, the derivative series `∑ −2 (x+(k+1))⁻³`
  is summable (comparison, same envelope as `tailSum_summable`).
* `posTail_localUnifBound` — on a real ball `ball x₀ r ⊆ (0,∞)`, the uniform bound
  `‖−2(y+(k+1))⁻³‖ ≤ u k` with `u` summable, the exact input to
  `hasDerivAt_tsum_of_isPreconnected`.
* `hasDerivAt_posTail` — **closed form** `HasDerivAt (tailSum) (∑ −2(x+(k+1))⁻³) x`
  for `x > 0`: term-by-term differentiation of the positive tail tsum, DONE.

## The single named residual (NOT an axiom)

The remaining content of sub-fact (i) — the *negative* bracket tsum
`∑ (x−(k+1))⁻²` (whose terms have poles in `(0,∞)` at every positive integer, so the
"`ball ⊆ (0,∞)`" trick must be replaced by "`ball ⊆ ℝ ∖ ℤ`") and the product/`sin²`
factor — plus the whole of sub-fact (ii) (Vaaler Theorem 6's J-FT) are bundled into
ONE named `Prop` `DerivInterpHClosedForm`, never an `axiom`.

## Hard constraints honoured

NEW leaf only; nothing existing/committed edited.  No
`axiom`/`sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`False.elim`/`absurd`/`not_*_input`.  Build
green; `#print axioms` of each result is `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-! ## §4 — CLOSED FORM: term-by-term differentiation of the positive tail tsum

**Closed form for `deriv tailSum` on `(0,∞)` (sub-fact (i), positive half).**
For `x > 0`, `HasDerivAt tailSum (∑_{k≥0} −2 (x+(k+1))⁻³) x`, i.e. the positive tail
tsum may be differentiated term by term, with the derivative series summable.  This
is the cleanly tractable half of sub-fact (i): the positive tail `∑(x+(k+1))⁻²` has
*no poles* on `(0,∞)`, so the local-uniform bound trick on `ball x₀ (x₀/2) ⊆ (0,∞)`
(rather than the integer-complement) closes it directly via Mathlib's
`hasDerivAt_tsum_of_isPreconnected`. -/

/-! ## §5 — The single named residual (NOT an axiom) and the closed-form assembly -/

/-- **The remaining content of the D-1 wall, bundled as ONE named `Prop` (never an
axiom).**  For `x ∉ ℤ` (here phrased as `sin πx ≠ 0`), the full interpolant
derivative has the Vaaler closed form `H′(x) = 2 J(x)`.  Discharging this requires:

* the *negative* bracket tsum `∑(x−(k+1))⁻²` differentiated term by term — unlike the
  positive tail (proven above by `hasDerivAt_posTail`), this series has poles at every
  positive integer, so the `ball ⊆ (0,∞)` envelope must be replaced by a
  `ball ⊆ ℝ∖ℤ` envelope (the same machinery as `VaalerSumInvSqProof.S_differentiableAt`,
  but for the *cube* derivative series and over ℝ);
* the product/chain rule through the `(sin πx/π)²` prefactor of `interpH`;
* the identification of the resulting closed form with `2·vaalerJ` — Vaaler Theorem 6,
  eqs (2.27)–(2.32), the J-Fourier-transform computation. -/

/-- **Bookkeeping: the positive-tail derivative is a genuine summand of the wall.**
`interpBracket` is `(negTail) − tailSum + 2·x⁻¹`; the `−tailSum` part already has a
closed-form derivative (`−1` times `hasDerivAt_posTail`), and the `2·x⁻¹` part has the
elementary derivative `−2·x⁻²`.  This records the two CHEAP, fully-proven summands of
`deriv interpBracket`, isolating the remaining hard summand (the negative-tail tsum
`negTail x = ∑(x−(k+1))⁻²`, which has poles in `(0,∞)`). -/
