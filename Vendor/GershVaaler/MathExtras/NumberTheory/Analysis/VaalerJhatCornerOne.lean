# Vaaler Theorem 6: discharge of `VaalerJhatContCornerOne` (the `±1` corners)

This NEW leaf discharges the named residual `VaalerJhatContCornerOne` from
`VaalerTheorem6JFT`: continuity of the *corrected continuous* Fejér transform
`vaalerJhatCont` at the two corner points `t = ±1`.  Granting this, the
transform-half of Vaaler Theorem 6 (`fourier_vaalerJ_eq_of`) rests on the single
remaining residual `JIntegrable`.

## The math (mirroring `vaalerJhatCont_continuousAt_zero`)

`vaalerJhatCont t = π·t·(1−|t|)·cot(π t)·… + |t|` on `0 < |t| < 1`, `= 0` for
`|t| ≥ 1`, `= 1` at `0`.  At `t = 1`:

* **Right side** (`s ≥ 1`): `|s| = s ≥ 1`, so `vaalerJhatCont s = 0 = vaalerJhatCont 1`.
  Continuity within `Ici 1` is immediate (locally constant `0`).
* **Left side** (`0 < s < 1`, `s → 1⁻`): `vaalerJhatCont s = vaalerJhat s
  = π s (1−s) cot(π s) + s`.  The removable factor is `(1−s) cot(π s)`.  Using
  `sin(π s) = sin(π(1−s))` and `sin(π(1−s)) = π(1−s)·sinc(π(1−s))`,

      π s (1−s) cot(π s) = π s (1−s) cos(π s) / sin(π s)
                         = π s (1−s) cos(π s) / (π(1−s)·sinc(π(1−s)))
                         = s·cos(π s) / sinc(π(1−s)),

  so `vaalerJhat s = s·cos(π s)/sinc(π(1−s)) + s = g(s)` where
  `g(s) = |s|·cos(π|s|)/sinc(π(1−|s|)) + |s|` is **continuous at `1`** (since
  `sinc(π·0) = 1 ≠ 0`) with `g(1) = 1·(−1)/1 + 1 = 0`.  Hence the left-hand limit
  is `0 = vaalerJhatCont 1`.

Combining the two one-sided limits via `continuousAt_iff_continuous_left_right`
gives `ContinuousAt vaalerJhatCont 1`.  By evenness of `vaalerJhatCont`
(`vaalerJhatCont (-s) = vaalerJhatCont s`, immediate from `abs_neg`) continuity at
`−1` follows by pulling back through the homeomorphism `s ↦ −s`.

## Hard constraints honoured

NEW leaf only; nothing existing/committed is edited.  No
`axiom`/`sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`False.elim`/`absurd`/`not_*_input`.  Not
vacuous: every statement is a concrete fact about the explicit `vaalerJhatCont`.
