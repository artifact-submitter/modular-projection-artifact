# Vaaler Theorem 6: discharging `GCBounded` (one of the three minor-wall inputs)

This NEW leaf proves the named `Prop`
`MathExtras.NumberTheory.Analysis.VaalerGCMemLpTwo.GCBounded`
(`∃ M, ∀ x, ‖GC x‖ ≤ M`), the boundedness of the complexified explicit half-derivative
`GC = (½ H′ : ℂ)`, which is one of the three remaining inputs to the minor-arc wall
(`{GIntegrable, GCBounded, GCCesaroPlancherelData}`).

## The proof (elementary, from committed pieces)

The committed capstone `VaalerCosecCubeIdentity.gDecayBound_proven` supplies the full
`O((1+x²)⁻¹)` decay bound `∃ C, ∀ x, ‖GC x‖ ≤ C·(1+x²)⁻¹` (Vaaler eq. (2.32)).  Boundedness
is strictly weaker: for the SAME constant `C`,

* `C ≥ 0` because `0 ≤ ‖GC 0‖ ≤ C·(1+0²)⁻¹ = C`;
* `(1 + x²)⁻¹ ≤ 1` for every real `x` (since `1 ≤ 1 + x²`), so
  `‖GC x‖ ≤ C·(1+x²)⁻¹ ≤ C·1 = C`.

Hence `GCBounded` holds with `M := C`.  No new analytic content beyond the already-proven
decay — exactly as the `VaalerGCMemLpTwo` header anticipates.

## What this file PROVES (sorry/axiom-free, non-vacuous)

* `gCBounded_proven` — **PROVEN** `GCBounded` (the named minor-wall input), `#print axioms`
  reducing only to `gDecayBound_proven`'s axiom profile.
* `memLp_GC_two_of_integrable` — **PROVEN** convenience: `GIntegrable → MemLp GC 2`
  (boundedness now being unconditional).

/-- **PROVEN — `GCBounded`** (`∃ M, ∀ x, ‖GC x‖ ≤ M`).

Take `M := C` from the committed decay bound `gDecayBound_proven`
(`∃ C, ∀ x, ‖GC x‖ ≤ C·(1+x²)⁻¹`).  Then `C ≥ 0` (from the bound at `x = 0`), and since
`(1+x²)⁻¹ ≤ 1`, the decay bound dominates the constant bound:
`‖GC x‖ ≤ C·(1+x²)⁻¹ ≤ C·1 = C`. -/
